# pydays2019 - Surpassing the R vs Python dogma
Slides for the talk at pydays 2019 in Vienna. [Info](https://cfp.linuxwochen.at/de/LWW19/public/events/861)

## Abstract
There is an ongoing fight between users of R and users of Python over which programming language is the best for data science. As a user of both, I think spending time elaborating pros and cons of the two is time wasted, especially because the discussion is usually led by dogmas. There is a lot going on to bring the two tools closer together by building bridges over the incompatibility gaps. Exchanging data between R and Python is a solved problem thanks to feather. Building on that thought, Wes McKinney and Hadley Wickham are collaborating to develop data science tools for R and Python. And with the latest RStudio version (1.2), Python might have found itself a proper IDE for data science. This talk will use feather, ursa labs, and the latest RStudio release to demonstrate how R and Python can work together and try to move away from dogma.
