## Contents

- Background - why we are talking about it
- Feather
- Apache Arrow
- Ursa Labs
- Rstudio 1.2 / reticulated python


## Background

- There is an argument in the data science space
- Can be observed by countless articles / blog posts etc on R vs Python
- <strong>BUT</strong>: this argument is not very helpful and divisive
- Focus should be on the task at hand, not the tools
  + you can drill a hole with a hammer, but it won't be elegant
- Both tools have strengths and weaknesses (not part of this talk)
- You are here to solve a problem, not to have a favourite algorithm or tool

## Reality check

- KD Nuggets Poll 2018: most of the people who use Python or R use both (44.1%)

```{r}
# library(tableHTML)
# dplyr::tibble('R only' = c('27.6 %'),
#            Python = c('28.7%'),
#            'R or Python Users' = c('72.7 %'),
#            N = c(2881)) %>% 
#   tableHTML(rownames = FALSE,
#             widths = c(80, 80, 100, 50)) %>% 
#   add_theme(theme = 'colorize') 

```

```{python}
from collections import Counter

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib_venn import venn2, venn2_circles

sets = Counter()
sets['01'] = 578
sets['11'] = 924
sets['10']  = 592
setLabels = ['Python', 'R']

c = venn2(subsets = sets,
          set_labels = setLabels)

c.get_patch_by_id('10').set_color('#125BBD')
c.get_patch_by_id('01').set_color('#366D9C')
c.get_patch_by_id('11').set_color('#FFD444')
for i in sets:
  c.get_patch_by_id(i).set_edgecolor('none')
  c.get_patch_by_id(i).set_alpha(1)

plt.show()
```

## What Python and R have in common

- A lot of data science teams use both
- both languages have rich interfaces to C / C++
- most of under-the-hood coding is done in C / C++

\

<strong>Would it not make sense to aim for interoperability?</strong>

## placeholder

add some bow to the story, outlook on the talk? 

## Feather

- Python and R use data frames as a fundamental data structure
  + Pandas data frame are based on the idea of R's data frames
- Implemented after the announcement of Apache Arrow
  + Aim: share data between Python and R 
  + Use a binary file format for data frames
  + bridge time until Apache Arrow is implemented
- Uses the Apache Arrow columnar specification to represent binary data **on disk** (zero-copy access)
- Fast, lightweight, and easy-to-use binary file format for storing data frames.
- High read and write performance.


- Quickly exchange data between Python and R code, however it's not designed for long-term data storage.

## Limitations of Feather

- Supports limited scalar value types, adequate only for representing typical data found in R and pandas
- Supports only a single batch of rows (no ability to append to existing files)
- Only non-nested data types and categorical (dictionary-encoded) types are supported

## Apache Arrow
A standarised, language-independent representation of in-memory columnar data

- Exchange data without conversion between the different languages including python and R (also C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, MATLAB, Ruby, and Rust.)
- Zero-copy dataflow
- Optimised for analysing purposes
- Supports flat and nested format and conveniently many native data types
- Backed by key developers of 13 major open source projects (including Cassandra, Hadoop, HBase, Parquet, Spark, ... )


## Apache Arrow

```{r}
library(tableHTML)
header_img <- c('<img src="https://arrow.apache.org/img/copy.png" width="450" height="400"></img>', 
                '<img src="https://arrow.apache.org/img/shared.png" width="450" height="400"></img>')
tibble::tibble(before = c('<ul> <li> Each system has its own internal memory format', 
                          '<ul> <li> 70-80% computation wasted on serialization and deserialization',
                          '<ul> <li> Similar functionaltiy implemented in multiple projects', 
                          ''), 
               after= c('<ul> <li>All systems utilize the same memory format',
                        '<ul> <li>No overhead for cross-system communication',
                        '<ul> <li>Projects can share functionality', 
                        '')) %>% 
  `names<-`(header_img) %>% 
  tableHTML(rownames=FALSE, escape = FALSE, footer = "source: arrow.apache.org") %>% 
  add_css_row(css=list('border', '1px solid transparent')) %>% 
  add_css_header(css=list('border', '1px solid transparent'), headers = 1:2) %>% 
  add_css_column(css=list('border', '1px solid transparent'), columns = 1:2)
```


## Ursa Labs

When to comes to the most fundamental tasks (data access, data manipulation, data analysis, ……. ), data science tools are not optimised to make use of state-of-the-art hardware, as the efforts has been mainly focused on machine learning problems.

- Ursa Labs is an organisation founded 
  + by Wes McKinney (and Hadley Wickham as advisor for R)
  + with the goal of advancing open source, cross-language software for data scientists
- Focuses on the data science tools of the Apache Arrow Project (Arrow has a broader application scope) 
- May expand to create software artifacts focused more specifically on the data science domain


## Rstudio 1.2 / reticulated python
### The package: reticulate
- Reticulate is an R package that makes it possible to embed a Python session within an R process.
- Provides wrapper functions to use python modules and scripts
    + import, python_source, repl_python, use_python, py_install, …… 
- Data conversion back and forth between the two languages happens through C++.
- R and Python variables are accessible from both environments.
    + The objects  py and r provide this access.

## Rstudio 1.2 / reticulated python
### The IDE: Rstudio 1.2
- Automatic access to a python REPL when stepping in a python script.
- Line-by-line execution of Python code.
- Support for Python syntax highlighting. 
- Autocompletion and Inline help for Python ...... HOOORAY!!!  
- R notebooks with Python code chunks.
- Automatic switch in the code history pane between Python and R.
- Sourcing full Python scripts.
- Display of matplotlib plots within the plots pane in RStudio and inline in the notebooks.

## Type conversion

```{r}
r_type <- c('Single-element vector','Multi-element vector','List of multiple types',
       'Named list','Matrix/Array','Data Frame','Function','NULL, TRUE, FALSE')

py_type <- c('Scalar','List','Tuple','Dict','NumPy ndarray','Pandas DataFrame',
        'Python function','None, True, False')

ex <- c('1, 1L, TRUE, "foo"','c(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), c(1L, 2L, 3L)','list(1L, TRUE, "foo")',
        'list(a = 1L, b = 2.0), dict(x = x_data)','matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)',
        'data.frame(x = c(1,2,3), y = c("a", "b", "c"))','function(x) x + 1','NULL, TRUE, FALSE')

source <- 'https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/'
  

library(tableHTML)

data.frame(R = r_type,
           Python = py_type,
           Examples = ex) %>% 
  tableHTML(rownames = FALSE,
            widths = c(200, 200, 300),
            footer = paste0("source: ", source)) %>% 
  tableHTML_to_image(zoom = 2)

```

## test code

- Python chunk 
```{python include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
import numpy as np

var_py = np.array([i for i in range(10)])
```

- R chunk - access python variables from R
```{r include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(reticulate)
# see what's in the python variable
py$var_py
# define a new variable in R 
r_var = py$var_py*2
```

- Or access R variables form python
```{python include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
var_reshaped = np.reshape(r.r_var, (5, 2))
print(var_reshaped)
```

## test

```{r}
grid::grid.raster(png::readPNG('img/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png'))
```

usual practice:

- Each system has its own internal memory format 
- 70-80% computation wasted on serialization and deserialization 
- Similar functionaltiy implemented in multiple projects

with arrow:

- All systems utilize the same memory format 
- No overhead for cross-systemcommunication 
- Projects can share functionality
